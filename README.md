# virtual-coffee

This repository contains a minimal slackbot that attempts to replicate some of donut's functionality (for free). The purpose is to schedule 1:1 conversations between people in the same workspace. It can currently only be run locally and doesn't do match except create conversations with unique pairs. 

## Coming next

- Deployment to slack app store
- GCal integration
- Zoom integration
